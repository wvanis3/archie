#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Fira Mono Medium
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. By default they are derived automatically, by the OSes
#: font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families that
#: have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For
#: example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 13.0

#: Font size (in pts)

# adjust_line_height  0
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

# cursor #cccccc

#: Default cursor color

# cursor_text_color #111111

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

# cursor_blink_interval      0.5
# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Note that numbers smaller than repaint_delay
#: will be limited to repaint_delay. Stop blinking cursor after the
#: specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to
#: never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down resizing of the terminal and also
#: use large amounts of RAM.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

# scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores one character in 4 bytes, so approximatively
#: 2500 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line. A value of zero or
#: less disables this feature. The maximum allowed size is 4GB.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.

# touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by a touchpad. Note this is only used
#: for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
#: Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

# url_color #0087BD
# url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

# open_url_modifiers kitty_mod

#: The modifier keys to press when clicking with the mouse on URLs to
#: open the URL

# open_url_with default

#: The program with which to open URLs that are clicked on. The
#: special value default means to use the operating system's default
#: URL handler.

# copy_on_select no

#: Copy to clipboard on select. With this enabled, simply selecting
#: text with the mouse will cause the text to be copied to clipboard.
#: Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not have the concept of
#: primary selections. Note that this is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the clipboard.

# rectangle_select_modifiers ctrl+alt

#: The modifiers to use rectangular selection (i.e. to select text in
#: a rectangular block with the mouse)

# select_by_word_characters :@-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alpha-numeric character in the unicode database will be matched.

# click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

# mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.

# focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

# enable_audio_bell yes

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

# remember_window_size  yes
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. For a list of available
#: layouts, see the
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#layouts.

# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing
#: and the lines value for vertical resizing.

# window_border_width 1.0

#: The width (in pts) of window borders. Will be rounded to the
#: nearest number of pixels based on screen resolution. Note that
#: borders are displayed only when more than one window is visible.
#: They are meant to separate multiple windows.

# draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 1.0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border)

# single_window_margin_width -1000.0

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead.

#window_padding_width 2.0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border)

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

# hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders). Whether
#: this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

# tab_bar_edge bottom

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts)

# tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of: fade, separator or hidden. In the
#: fade style, each tab's edges fade into the background color, in the
#: separator style, tabs are separated by a configurable separator.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " ┇"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# tab_title_template {title}

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N.

# active_tab_foreground   #000
# active_tab_background   #eee
# active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
# inactive_tab_foreground #444
# inactive_tab_background #999

#: }}}

#: Advanced {{{

# shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login to ensure that the shell starts in interactive mode and
#: reads its startup rc files.

# editor .

#: The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or
#: similar tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variable
#: EDITOR. Note that this environment variable has to be set not just
#: in your shell startup scripts but system-wide, otherwise kitty will
#: not see it.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections.

# env 

#: Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
#: that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
#: use::

#:     env MYVAR1=a
#:     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

#: The value of MYVAR2 will be a/<path to home directory>/b.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#sessions in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable if used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, a value of
#: background means to use the background color of the currently
#: active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
#: #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack, as
#: there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color
#: of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it
#: is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both,
#: you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
#: hide_window_decorations.

# macos_option_as_alt yes

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (Option+Tab) on macOS.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes. For example, a value of
#: 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-pixel
#: antialiasing at common font sizes.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the traditional full-screen transition, that is faster, but
#: less pretty.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Enable/disable custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see
#: on both light and dark backgrounds. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines.
